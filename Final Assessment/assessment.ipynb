    "### The Federalist Papers - History Mystery!\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Federalist Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers) are a set of essays written between 1787 and 1788 by [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton), [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison) and [John Jay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay).  Initially published under the pseudonym 'Publius', their intent was to encourage the ratification of the then-new Constitution of the United States of America.  In later years, a list emerged where the author of each one of the 85 papers was identified.  Nevertheless, for a subset of these papers the author is still in question.  The problem of the Federalist Papers authorship attribution has been a subject of much research in statistical NLP in the past.   Now you will try to solve this question with your own BERT-based project model.\n",

    "In concrete terms, the problem is identifying, for each one of the disputed papers, whether Alexander Hamilton or James Madison are the authors.  For this exercise, you can assume that each paper has a single author, i.e., that no collaboration took place (though *that* is not 100% certain!), and that each author has a well-defined writing style that is displayed across all the identified papers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Project\n",
    "You are provided with labeled `train.tsv` and `dev.tsv` datasets for the project.  There are 10 test sets, one for each of the disputed papers.  All datasets are contained in the `data/federalist_papers_HM` directory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each \"sentence\" is actually a group of sentences of approximately 256 words.  The labels are '0' for HAMILTON and '1' for MADISON.  There are more papers by Hamilton in the example files than by Madison.  The validation set has been created with approximately the same distribution of the two labels as in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build neural networks using NeMo, as you did in Lab 2.  You'll train your model and test it.  Then you'll use provided collation code to see what answers your model gives to the \"history mystery\"! \n",

    "* **Batch size (BATCH_SIZE):**<br>\n",
    "Larger batch sizes train faster, but large language models tend to use up the available memory quickly.\n",
    "* **Memory usage:**<br>\n",
    "Some of the models are very large.   If you get \"RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory\" during training, you'll know you need to reduce the batch size, sequence length, and/or choose a smaller language model, restart the kernel, and try again from the beginning of the notebook.\n",
    "* **Accuracy and loss:**<br>\n",
    "It is definitely possible to achieve 95% or more model accuracy for this project.  In addition to changes in accuracy as the model trains, pay attention to the loss value.  You want the loss value to be dropping and getting very small for best results.\n",

      "Concerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States For the Independent Journal .To the People of the State of New York : THE three last numbers of this paper have been dedicated to an enumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed , in a state of disunion , from the arms and arts of foreign nations .I shall now proceed to delineate dangers of a different and , perhaps , still more alarming kind -- those which will in all probability flow from dissensions between the States themselves , and from domestic factions and convulsions .These have been already in some instances slightly anticipated ; but they deserve a more particular and more full investigation .A man must be far gone in Utopian speculations who can seriously doubt that , if these States should either be wholly disunited , or only united in partial confederacies , the subdivisions into which they might be thrown would have frequent and violent contests with each other .To presume a want of motives for such contests as an argument against their existence , would be to forget that men are ambitious , vindictive , and rapacious .To look for a continuation of harmony between a number of independent , unconnected sovereignties in the same neighborhood , would be to disregard the uniform course of human events , and to set at defiance the accumulated experience of ages .The causes of hostility among nations are innumerable .\t0\n",
      "There are some which have a general and almost constant operation upon the collective bodies of society .Of this description are the love of power or the desire of pre-eminence and dominion -- the jealousy of power , or the desire of equality and safety .There are others which have a more circumscribed though an equally operative influence within their spheres .Such are the rivalships and competitions of commerce between commercial nations .And there are others , not less numerous than either of the former , which take their origin entirely in private passions ; in the attachments , enmities , interests , hopes , and fears of leading individuals in the communities of which they are members .Men of this class , whether the favorites of a king or of a people , have in too many instances abused the confidence they possessed ; and assuming the pretext of some public motive , have not scrupled to sacrifice the national tranquillity to personal advantage or personal gratification .The celebrated Pericles , in compliance with the resentment of a prostitute,1 at the expense of much of the blood and treasure of his countrymen , attacked , vanquished , and destroyed the city of the SAMNIANS .The same man , stimulated by private pique against the MEGARENSIANS,2 another nation of Greece , or to avoid a prosecution with which he was threatened as an accomplice of a supposed theft of the statuary Phidias,3 or to get rid of the accusations prepared to be brought against him for dissipating the funds of the state in the purchase of popularity,4 or from a combination of all these causes , was the primitive author of that famous and fatal war , distinguished in the Grecian annals by the name of the PELOPONNESIAN war ; which , after various vicissitudes , intermissions , and renewals , terminated in the ruin of the Athenian commonwealth .\t0\n",
      "The ambitious cardinal , who was prime minister to Henry VIII. , permitting his vanity to aspire to the triple crown,5 entertained hopes of succeeding in the acquisition of that splendid prize by the influence of the Emperor Charles V. To secure the favor and interest of this enterprising and powerful monarch , he precipitated England into a war with France , contrary to the plainest dictates of policy , and at the hazard of the safety and independence , as well of the kingdom over which he presided by his counsels , as of Europe in general .For if there ever was a sovereign who bid fair to realize the project of universal monarchy , it was the Emperor Charles V. , of whose intrigues Wolsey was at once the instrument and the dupe .The influence which the bigotry of one female,6 the petulance of another,7 and the cabals of a third,8 had in the contemporary policy , ferments , and pacifications , of a considerable part of Europe , are topics that have been too often descanted upon not to be generally known .To multiply examples of the agency of personal considerations in the production of great national events , either foreign or domestic , according to their direction , would be an unnecessary waste of time .Those who have but a superficial acquaintance with the sources from which they are to be drawn , will themselves recollect a variety of instances ; and those who have a tolerable knowledge of human nature will not stand in need of such lights to form their opinion either of the reality or extent of that agency .\t0\n",

      "There have been , if I may so express it , almost as many popular as royal wars .The cries of the nation and the importunities of their representatives have , upon various occasions , dragged their monarchs into war , or continued them in it , contrary to their inclinations , and sometimes contrary to the real interests of the State .In that memorable struggle for superiority between the rival houses of AUSTRIA and BOURBON , which so long kept Europe in a flame , it is well known that the antipathies of the English against the French , seconding the ambition , or rather the avarice , of a favorite leader,10 protracted the war beyond the limits marked out by sound policy , and for a considerable time in opposition to the views of the court .The wars of these two last-mentioned nations have in a great measure grown out of commercial considerations , -- the desire of supplanting and the fear of being supplanted , either in particular branches of traffic or in the general advantages of trade and navigation .From this summary of what has taken place in other countries , whose situations have borne the nearest resemblance to our own , what reason can we have to confide in those reveries which would seduce us into an expectation of peace and cordiality between the members of the present confederacy , in a state of separation ? Have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with promises of an exemption from the imperfections , weaknesses and evils incident to society in every shape ?\t0\n",
      "They would , at the same time , be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of government , in doing which their constitutions would acquire a progressive direction toward monarchy .It is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative authority .The expedients which have been mentioned would soon give the States or confederacies that made use of them a superiority over their neighbors .Small states , or states of less natural strength , under vigorous governments , and with the assistance of disciplined armies , have often triumphed over large states , or states of greater natural strength , which have been destitute of these advantages .Neither the pride nor the safety of the more important States or confederacies would permit them long to submit to this mortifying and adventitious superiority .They would quickly resort to means similar to those by which it had been effected , to reinstate themselves in their lost pre-eminence .Thus , we should , in a little time , see established in every part of this country the same engines of despotism which have been the scourge of the Old World .This , at least , would be the natural course of things ; and our reasonings will be the more likely to be just , in proportion as they are accommodated to this standard .These are not vague inferences drawn from supposed or speculative defects in a Constitution , the whole power of which is lodged in the hands of a people , or their representatives and delegates , but they are solid conclusions , drawn from the natural and necessary progress of human affairs .\t0\n",
      "Such a point gained from the British government , and which could not be expected without an equivalent in exemptions and immunities in our markets , would be likely to have a correspondent effect on the conduct of other nations , who would not be inclined to see themselves altogether supplanted in our trade .A further resource for influencing the conduct of European nations toward us , in this respect , would arise from the establishment of a federal navy .There can be no doubt that the continuance of the Union under an efficient government would put it in our power , at a period not very distant , to create a navy which , if it could not vie with those of the great maritime powers , would at least be of respectable weight if thrown into the scale of either of two contending parties .This would be more peculiarly the case in relation to operations in the West Indies .A few ships of the line , sent opportunely to the reinforcement of either side , would often be sufficient to decide the fate of a campaign , on the event of which interests of the greatest magnitude were suspended .Our position is , in this respect , a most commanding one .And if to this consideration we add that of the usefulness of supplies from this country , in the prosecution of military operations in the West Indies , it will readily be perceived that a situation so favorable would enable us to bargain with great advantage for commercial privileges .\t0\n"

      "A little consideration will satisfy us , that the species of security sought for in the multiplication of the Executive , is nattainable .Numbers must be so great as to render combination difficult , or they are rather a source of danger than of security .The united credit and influence of several individuals must be more formidable to liberty , than the credit and influence of either of them separately .When power , therefore , is placed in the hands of so small a number of men , as to admit of their interests and views being easily combined in a common enterprise , by an artful leader , it becomes more liable to abuse , and more dangerous when abused , than if it be lodged in the hands of one man ; who , from the very circumstance of his being alone , will be more narrowly watched and more readily suspected , and who can not unite so great a mass of influence as when he is associated with others .The Decemvirs of Rome , whose name denotes their number,3 were more to be dreaded in their usurpation than any ONE of them would have been .No person would think of proposing an Executive much more numerous than that body ; from six to a dozen have been suggested for the number of the council .The extreme of these numbers , is not too great for an easy combination ; and from such a combination America would have more to fear , than from the ambition of any single individual .                                                                                               2\n",
      "That unity is conducive to energy will not be disputed .Decision , activity , secrecy , and despatch will generally characterize the proceedings of one man in a much more eminent degree than the proceedings of any greater number ; and in proportion as the number is increased , these qualities will be diminished .This unity may be destroyed in two ways : either by vesting the power in two or more magistrates of equal dignity and authority ; or by vesting it ostensibly in one man , subject , in whole or in part , to the control and co-operation of others , in the capacity of counsellors to him .Of the first , the two Consuls of Rome may serve as an example ; of the last , we shall find examples in the constitutions of several of the States .New York and New Jersey , if I recollect right , are the only States which have intrusted the executive authority wholly to single men.1 Both these methods of destroying the unity of the Executive have their partisans ; but the votaries of an executive council are the most numerous .They are both liable , if not to equal , to similar objections , and may in most lights be examined in conjunction .The experience of other nations will afford little instruction on this head .As far , however , as it teaches any thing , it teaches us not to be enamoured of plurality in the Executive .                                                                                                                                                       2\n",
      "The Executive Department Further Considered From the New York Packet .Tuesday , March 18 , 1788 .To the People of the State of New York : THERE is an idea , which is not without its advocates , that a vigorous Executive is inconsistent with the genius of republican government .The enlightened well-wishers to this species of government must at least hope that the supposition is destitute of foundation ; since they can never admit its truth , without at the same time admitting the condemnation of their own principles .Energy in the Executive is a leading character in the definition of good government .It is essential to the protection of the community against foreign attacks ; it is not less essential to the steady administration of the laws ; to the protection of property against those irregular and high-handed combinations which sometimes interrupt the ordinary course of justice ; to the security of liberty against the enterprises and assaults of ambition , of faction , and of anarchy .Every man the least conversant in Roman story , knows how often that republic was obliged to take refuge in the absolute power of a single man , under the formidable title of Dictator , as well against the intrigues of ambitious individuals who aspired to the tyranny , and the seditions of whole classes of the community whose conduct threatened the existence of all government , as against the invasions of external enemies who menaced the conquest and destruction of Rome .          2\n",

      "I am persuaded that it is the best which our political situation , habits , and opinions will admit , and superior to any the revolution has produced .Concessions on the part of the friends of the plan , that it has not a claim to absolute perfection , have afforded matter of no small triumph to its enemies . `` Why , `` say they , `` should we adopt an imperfect thing ? Why not amend it and make it perfect before it is irrevocably established ? ''This may be plausible enough , but it is only plausible .In the first place I remark , that the extent of these concessions has been greatly exaggerated .They have been stated as amounting to an admission that the plan is radically defective , and that without material alterations the rights and the interests of the community can not be safely confided to it .This , as far as I have understood the meaning of those who make the concessions , is an entire perversion of their sense .No advocate of the measure can be found , who will not declare as his sentiment , that the system , though it may not be perfect in every part , is , upon the whole , a good one ; is the best that the present views and circumstances of the country will permit ; and is such an one as promises every species of security which a reasonable people can desire .                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

      "The observations of the judicious Blackstone,1 in reference to the latter , are well worthy of recital : `` To bereave a man of life , Usays he , e or by violence to confiscate his estate , without accusation or trial , would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism , as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation ; but confinement of the person , by secretly hurrying him to jail , where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten , is a less public , a less striking , and therefore A MORE DANGEROUS ENGINE of arbitrary government . ''And as a remedy for this fatal evil he is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the habeas-corpus act , which in one place he calls `` the BULWARK of the British Constitution . `` 2 Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility .This may truly be denominated the corner-stone of republican government ; for so long as they are excluded , there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people .To the second that is , to the pretended establishment of the common and state law by the Constitution , I answer , that they are expressly made subject `` to such alterations and provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make concerning the same . ``                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
      "Or , if inequalities should still exist , they would neither be so great in their degree , so uniform in their operation , nor so odious in their appearance , as those which would necessarily spring from quotas , upon any scale that can possibly be devised .It is a signal advantage of taxes on articles of consumption , that they contain in their own nature a security against excess .They prescribe their own limit ; which can not be exceeded without defeating the end proposed , that is , an extension of the revenue .When applied to this object , the saying is as just as it is witty , that , `` in political arithmetic , two and two do not always make four . ''If duties are too high , they lessen the consumption ; the collection is eluded ; and the product to the treasury is not so great as when they are confined within proper and moderate bounds .This forms a complete barrier against any material oppression of the citizens by taxes of this class , and is itself a natural limitation of the power of imposing them .Impositions of this kind usually fall under the denomination of indirect taxes , and must for a long time constitute the chief part of the revenue raised in this country .Those of the direct kind , which principally relate to land and buildings , may admit of a rule of apportionment .                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",

      "There can be no need , however , to multiply arguments or examples on this head .A feeble Executive implies a feeble execution of the government .A feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad execution ; and a government ill executed , whatever it may be in theory , must be , in practice , a bad government .Taking it for granted , therefore , that all men of sense will agree in the necessity of an energetic Executive , it will only remain to inquire , what are the ingredients which constitute this energy ? How far can they be combined with those other ingredients which constitute safety in the republican sense ? And how far does this combination characterize the plan which has been reported by the convention ?

      "This would be the more likely to take place , as the delinquencies of the larger members might be expected sometimes to proceed from an ambitious premeditation in their rulers , with a view to getting rid of all external control upon their designs of personal aggrandizement ; the better to effect which it is presumable they would tamper beforehand with leading individuals in the adjacent States .If associates could not be found at home , recourse would be had to the aid of foreign powers , who would seldom be disinclined to encouraging the dissensions of a Confederacy , from the firm union of which they had so much to fear .When the sword is once drawn , the passions of men observe no bounds of moderation .The suggestions of wounded pride , the instigations of irritated resentment , would be apt to carry the States against which the arms of the Union were exerted , to any extremes necessary to avenge the affront or to avoid the disgrace of submission .The first war of this kind would probably terminate in a dissolution of the Union .This may be considered as the violent death of the Confederacy .Its more natural death is what we now seem to be on the point of experiencing , if the federal system be not speedily renovated in a more substantial form .It is not probable , considering the genius of this country , that the complying States would often be inclined to support the authority of the Union by engaging in a war against the non-complying States .                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "In addition to these persuasive considerations , it may be observed , that the same reasons which show the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin , prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin .Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin , there might be as many different currencies as States , and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded ; retrospective alterations in its value might be made , and thus the citizens of other States be injured , and animosities be kindled among the States themselves .The subjects of foreign powers might suffer from the same cause , and hence the Union be discredited and embroiled by the indiscretion of a single member .No one of these mischiefs is less incident to a power in the States to emit paper money , than to coin gold or silver .The power to make any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of debts , is withdrawn from the States , on the same principle with that of issuing a paper currency .Bills of attainder , ex-post-facto laws , and laws impairing the obligation of contracts , are contrary to the first principles of the social compact , and to every principle of sound legislation .The two former are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of the State constitutions , and all of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental charters .                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
      "It would otherwise be a mere treaty , dependent on the good faith of the parties , and not a government , which is only another word for POLITICAL POWER AND SUPREMACY .But it will not follow from this doctrine that acts of the large society which are NOT PURSUANT to its constitutional powers , but which are invasions of the residuary authorities of the smaller societies , will become the supreme law of the land .These will be merely acts of usurpation , and will deserve to be treated as such .Hence we perceive that the clause which declares the supremacy of the laws of the Union , like the one we have just before considered , only declares a truth , which flows immediately and necessarily from the institution of a federal government .It will not , I presume , have escaped observation , that it EXPRESSLY confines this supremacy to laws made PURSUANT TO THE CONSTITUTION ; which I mention merely as an instance of caution in the convention ; since that limitation would have been to be understood , though it had not been expressed .Though a law , therefore , laying a tax for the use of the United States would be supreme in its nature , and could not legally be opposed or controlled , yet a law for abrogating or preventing the collection of a tax laid by the authority of the State , ( unless upon imports and exports ) , would not be the supreme law of the land , but a usurpation of power not granted by the Constitution .                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",
      "Was , then , the American Revolution effected , was the American Confederacy formed , was the precious blood of thousands spilt , and the hard-earned substance of millions lavished , not that the people of America should enjoy peace , liberty , and safety , but that the government of the individual States , that particular municipal establishments , might enjoy a certain extent of power , and be arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of sovereignty ? We have heard of the impious doctrine in the Old World , that the people were made for kings , not kings for the people .Is the same doctrine to be revived in the New , in another shape that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed to the views of political institutions of a different form ? It is too early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the public good , the real welfare of the great body of the people , is the supreme object to be pursued ; and that no form of government whatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this object .Were the plan of the convention adverse to the public happiness , my voice would be , Reject the plan .Were the Union itself inconsistent with the public happiness , it would be , Abolish the Union .In like manner , as far as the sovereignty of the States can not be reconciled to the happiness of the people , the voice of every good citizen must be , Let the former be sacrificed to the latter .                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
      "The moment we launch into conjectures about the usurpations of the federal government , we get into an unfathomable abyss , and fairly put ourselves out of the reach of all reasoning .Imagination may range at pleasure till it gets bewildered amidst the labyrinths of an enchanted castle , and knows not on which side to turn to extricate itself from the perplexities into which it has so rashly adventured .Whatever may be the limits or modifications of the powers of the Union , it is easy to imagine an endless train of possible dangers ; and by indulging an excess of jealousy and timidity , we may bring ourselves to a state of absolute scepticism and irresolution .I repeat here what I have observed in substance in another place , that all observations founded upon the danger of usurpation ought to be referred to the composition and structure of the government , not to the nature or extent of its powers .The State governments , by their original constitutions , are invested with complete sovereignty .In what does our security consist against usurpation from that quarter ? Doubtless in the manner of their formation , and in a due dependence of those who are to administer them upon the people .If the proposed construction of the federal government be found , upon an impartial examination of it , to be such as to afford , to a proper extent , the same species of security , all apprehensions on the score of usurpation ought to be discarded .                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
